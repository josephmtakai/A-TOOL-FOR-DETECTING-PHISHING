## Features

- Analyzes URLs to classify them as phishing or legitimate.
- Uses a Decision Tree classifier for detection.
- Extracts various features from URLs for classification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pandas` library
- `numpy` library
- `scikit-learn` library
- `joblib` library

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-detection-tool.git
   cd phishing-detection-tool
   
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

Install the Required Libraries:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib

Usage
Training the Model
Ensure the urls.csv dataset file is in the same directory as the script.

Run the tpython train_model.py
raining script:
python train_model.py

This script will:

Load the dataset.
Extract features from the URLs.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a Decision Tree classifier.
Evaluate the model's accuracy.
Save the trained model to phishing_detector.pkl.

Using the Model for Prediction
Run the prediction script:
python phishing_detector.py

Input the URL you want to check when prompted.

The script will output whether the URL is Phishing or Legitimate.

Dataset
The urls.csv file should have the following format
url,label
http://example.com,0
http://phishing-site.com,1
https://safe-site.com,0
http://malicious.com,1

url: The URL to be analyzed.
label: The label indicating if the URL is phishing (1) or legitimate (0).
